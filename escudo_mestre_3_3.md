# Exhaustion

```
LevelEffect
1 Disadvantage on ability checks
2 Speed halved
3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4 Hit point maximum halved
5 Speed reduced to 0
6 Death
```
```
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as
specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion
effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced
below 1.
```
```
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion
level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested
food and drink.
```
## Food

```
One pound of food per day, or make food last longer by
subsisting on half rations. Half pound of food a day
counts as half day "without food". Normal day eating
resets count to zero.
```
```
A character can go without food for 3 +CON days
(minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a
character suffers one level of exhaustion.
```
## Water

```
One gallon of water per day, or two if the weather is hot.
A character who drinks half must succeed on a DC
Con saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at end
of day. Less water automatically fails.
```
```
If the character already has one or more levels of
exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
```
## Resting

```
Short Rest: 1 hour, spend one or more hit-die; recover
hit-die roll + CON modifier HP.
Long Rest: 8 hours (max. 2 hours on watch); recover all
HP, regain a total of half your max hit-die.
```
```
Must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to
gain these benefits. Once per 24 hours.
```

# Combat

```
1. Determine surprise.
2. Establish positions.
3. Roll initiative. d20 + DEX (Dexterity ability check)
4. Each round, take turns in Initiative order.
```
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed
and take one action. You can also interact with one object
or feature of the environment for free, during either your
move or your action.

## Surprise

Compare Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding
with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each
creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster
that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the
encounter.

A surprised creature may not move, take an action or use
a reaction until that turn ends.

## Cover

Half cover: +2 AC and Dexterity saves.
Three-quarters cover: +5 AC and Dexterity saves.
Total cover: can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a
spell. Area-of-effect spells may still have effect.

## Resistance / Vulnerability

Damage resistance: Damage of that type is halved.
Damage vulnerability: Damage of that type is doubled.

## Two-Weapon Fighting

If attacking with a light melee weapon that one hand, use
a bonus action to attack with a different light melee
weapon that in the other hand (can be thrown). Ability
modifiers are not added to the damage of the bonus
attack, unless that modifier is negative.

## Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

A creature making a ranged attack has disadvantage on
the attack roll if it is within 5 feet of a hostile creature
who can see it and who isn’t incapacitated.

## Attacks Against Prone Creatures

Attackers within 5 feet have advantage on attacks against
prone creatures. Outside of 5 feet, attacks have
disadvantage.

# Combat Actions

## Attack

```
Make one melee or ranged attack.
1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s
range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether
the target has cover and whether you have advantage
or disadvantage against the target. Spells, special
abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or
bonuses to your attack roll.
3. Resolve the attack. If the d20 roll for an attack is a
20, the attack is a hit and is a critical hit. If the d
roll for an attack is a 1, it is a miss.
```
```
Critical Hit: Roll the attack’s damage dice twice, then
add modifiers as normal.
```
```
Attacking Underwater. Melee has disadvantage unless
creature has swim speed or is using dagger, javelin,
shortsword, spear, or trident.
Ranged has disadvantage unless using crossbow, a net,
or javelin-like. Auto miss beyond weapon's normal range.
Fully immersed creatures have resistance to fire damage.
```
```
Opportunity Attacks: Use a reaction to make a melee
attack against a creature that moves out of reach. The
attack interrupts the provoking creature’s movement,
right before the creature leaves your reach. Forced
movement and teleportation do not trigger an
opportunity attack.
```
## Cast a Spell

```
Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether
the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or
even hours to cast the spell.
```
## Dash

```
Double your speed after applying any modifiers.
```
## Disengage

```
Movement does not provoke opportunity attacks for the
rest of the turn.
```
## Dodge

```
Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made
against you has Disadvantage if you can see the attacker,
and Dexterity saving throws have Advantage. This ends if
you are incapacitated (see Conditions) or if your speed
drops to 0.
```
## Help

```
The targeted creature gains Advantage on the next ability
check it makes to perform the task, provided that it
makes the check before the start of your next turn.
Alternatively, aid a friendly creature in attacking a
creature within 5 feet. If the ally attacks the target before
your next turn, the first attack roll is made with
Advantage.
```
## Hide

```
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide.
```
## Search

```
Devote your attention to finding something. Depending
on the nature of your search, the DM might have you
make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence
(Investigation) check.
```
## Use an Object

```
Interact with an object.
```
## Ready

```
Act later in the round using your reaction. Decide what
perceivable circumstance will trigger the reaction. Then,
choose the action taken in response, or choose to move
up to your speed in response to it. When the trigger
occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the
trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. If a spell is readied
it is cast as normal and release with a reaction when the
trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting
time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic
requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your
concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without
taking effect.
```
## Grappling and Shoving

```
Use an Attack action to grapple or shove. The target
must be no more than one size larger than you, and it
must be within your reach. You make a Strength
(Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
```
```
A successful shove pushes the target 5 feet away from
you. A successful grapple subjects the target to the
grappled condition, and they can be dragged around by
you, but your movement speed is halved.
```

# Conditions and States

## Blinded

A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any
ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the
creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls
have disadvantage.

## Charmed

A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target
the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
The charmer has advantage on any ability check to
interact socially with the creature.

## Deafened

A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails
any ability check that requires hearing.

## Frightened

A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks
and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line
of sight. The creature can’t willingly move closer to the
source of its fear.

## Grappled

A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t
benefit from any bonus to its speed. The condition ends if
the grappler is incapacitated. The condition also ends if
an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach
of the grappler or grappling effect.

## Incapacitated

An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

## Invisible

An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid
of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding,
the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location
can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it
leaves. Attack rolls against the creature have
disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have
advantage.

## Paralyzed

A paralyzed creature is incapacitated and can’t move or
speak, and automatically fails Strength and Dexterity
saving throws. Attacks against the creature have
advantage, and are a critical hit if the attacker is within 5
feet of the creature.

## Petrified

```
A petrified creature is transformed, along with any
nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid
inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases
by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. The creature is
incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its
surroundings. Attack rolls against the creature have
advantage. The creature automatically fails Strength and
Dexterity saving throws. The creature has resistance to
all damage. The creature is immune to poison and
disease, although a poison or disease already in its
system is suspended, not neutralized.
```
## Poisoned

```
A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and
ability checks.
```
## Prone

```
A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl (see
Movement), unless it stands up and thereby ends the
condition. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the
attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the
attack roll has disadvantage. Standing from prone costs
half movement.
```
## Restrained

```
A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t
benefit from any bonus to its speed. Attack rolls against
the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack
rolls have disadvantage. The creature has disadvantage
on Dexterity saving throws.
```
## Stunned

```
A stunned creature is incapacitated, can’t move, and can
speak only falteringly. The creature automatically fails
Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls
against the creature have advantage.
```
## Unconscious

```
An unconscious creature is incapacitated and paralyzed.
The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.
The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity
saving throws. Attacks against the creature have
advantage, and is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5
feet of the creature.
```
# Death and Resurrection

```
Instant Death: When damage reduces you to 0 hit
points and there is damage remaining, you die if the
remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point
maximum.
Falling Unconscious: If damage reduces you to 0 hit
points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see
Conditions). This ends if you regain any hit points.
```
## Death Saving Throws

```
Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, roll a d20.
If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you
fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your
third success, you become stable. On your third failure,
you die. The number of both is reset to zero when you
regain any hit points or become stable.
```
```
Rolling 1 or 20: When you make a death saving throw
and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you
roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point and become
conscious.
```
## Damage at Zero Hit Points

```
If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you
suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from
a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the
damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you
suffer instant death.
```
