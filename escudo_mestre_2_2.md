# Actions in Combat

**ATTACK:** Make a melee or ranged attack.

**CAST A SPELL:** Spell must have a casting time of 1 action.

**CLIMB ONTO BIGGER CREATURE:** Athletics or Acrobatics

target’s space as difficult terrain. Target may take an
action to make an Athletics check against your
Athletics or Acrobatics to dislodge you.

**DASH:** Move extra distance equal to your current speed.

**DISARM:** Attack roll vs. target’s Athletics or Acrobatics.
No damage on success, but target drops held item.
Attack has disadvantage if target item is being held in
both hands.

**DISENGAGE:** Your movement this turn does not provoke
attacks of opportunity.

**DODGE:** Attacks made against you have disadvantage
and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
until the start of your next turn. No longer applies if
your speed drops to 0 or you are incapacitated.

**ESCAPE GRAPPLE:** Athletics or Acrobatics vs. Athletics.

**FIRST AID:** DC 10 Medicine to stabilize dying creature.

**GRAPPLE:** Replaces one attack. Athletics vs. Athletics or
Acrobatics. On success, target becomes Grappled.

make before the start of your next turn, or on an
attack against a creature within 5 feet of you before
the start of your next turn.

**HIDE:** Make a stealth check to become hidden.

**MARK:** Can mark target in addition to melee attack. Your
opportunity attacks against marked target have
advantage until start of your next turn and do not use
your reaction. You are still limited to 1 per turn.

**OVERRUN:** Athletics vs. Athletics to move through an
opponent’s space. Advantage if larger than target,
disadvantage if smaller.

**READY:** Ready an action to use later when a certain
trigger occurs. Using this is a reaction and does not
interrupt the trigger. Spells require concentration until
they go off.

**SHOVE:** As Grapple, but can choose to push 5 feet away
or knock prone. Can try to shove aside to another
space within 5 feet of you, but roll at disadvantage.

# Things that Break

# Concentration

### CASTING ANOTHER SPELL THAT REQUIRES

**CONCENTRATION:** You cannot concentrate on two
spells at once. You **can** , however, cast spells that
do not require concentration while concentrating
on a different spell.

**TAKING DAMAGE or OVERWHELMING
DISTRACTION:** Make a Constitution save with a DC
of 10 or half the damage you took, whichever is
higher. If you fail the saving throw, your
concentration ends. Make a separate saving throw
for each source of damage.

**BEING INCAPACITATED or KILLED:** Duh.

# Spellcasting

# Requirements

**SPELLCASTING FOCUS:** Can replace material
component. Holy symbol must be held or worn
visibly.

**VERBAL COMPONENT (V):** Cannot cast while gagged
or in area of silence.

**SOMATIC COMPONENT (S):** Must have free use of at
least one hand to perform gestures.

**MATERIAL COMPONENT (M):** Must have specific
components required by the spell on their person.
If components are consumed by the spell, must
provide enough components for each casting. Must
have one hand free to access the components.

**A CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET:** Target cannot be
behind total cover. If you try to cast an area of
effect spell with something in the way, the area of
effect begins on the near side of the obstruction.

# Overlapping Spells

Spells can only overlap with different spells. While
two instances of one spell overlap, the version of
the spell with the higher numbers is applied.

# Death & Dying

```
INSTANT DEATH: If you drop to 0 HP and
there is damage remaining that exceeds your
maximum HP, you die instantly.
DEATH SAVING THROWS: If you start your
turn with 0 HP, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher,
you succeed; on a 9 or lower, you fail. At three
successes, you are stabilized; at three failures,
you are dead. A natural 20 counts as 2
successes, a natural 1 counts as 2 failures.
DAMAGE WHILE DYING: You suffer a saving
throw failure if you take damage while dying.
STABILIZING: Stable creatures do not make
death saving throws and regain 1 HP after 1d
hours.
```

# Special Movement

**LONG JUMP:** Up to Strength score in feet
with 10 foot running start and half that
distance with a standing start. If landing
on difficult terrain, DC 10 Acrobatics or
fall prone.

**HIGH JUMP:** Up to 3 + Strength mod feet
with 10 foot running start and half that
height with a standing start.

**FLIGHT:** If a flying creature is knocked
prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is
otherwise prevented from moving, it falls
and takes 1d10 damage for every 10 feet
it plummets. The ability to hover or
magical means of flight negate this.

**UNDERWATER COMBAT:** Creatures that
do not have a swim speed have
disadvantage on melee attacks not made
with a dagger, shortsword, spear, or
trident. Ranged weapons cannot hit
beyond their normal range, and have
disadvantage unless they are crossbows,
nets, or javelin-type throwing weapons.

Creatures immersed in water have
resistance to fire damage.

**MOUNTED COMBAT:** A willing creature
that is one size larger than you and
physically capable of carrying you can
serve as a mount. You can mount or
dismount a creature within 5 feet of you
once during your move, though this costs
half your movement speed.

If an effect moves your mount against its
will or you are knocked prone while you
are mounted, make a DC 10 Dexterity
save or be thrown off. You have
advantage on this check if using a saddle.
If your mount is knocked prone, you may
take a reaction to land on your feet;
otherwise, you fall prone within 5 feet of
your mount.

A mount that is not acting independently
moves as you direct it, and may take the
Dash, Disengage, and Dodge actions. A
controlled mount can act on the turn you
mount it. If the mount provokes an
opportunity attack while you’re on it, the
attacker can choose to either target you
or the mount.

# Environment

```
FALLING: Falling deals 1d
bludgeoning damage for every 10
feet you fall, up to 20d6.
SUFFOCATING: You can hold breath
for a number of minutes equal to 1
+ your Constitution modifier
(minimum 30 seconds). Afterwards,
you can last a number of rounds
equal to your Constitution modifier
(minimum 1) but drop to 0 and
starts dying at start of your next
turn afterwards.
FOOD: You need 1 pound of food
per day. Half rations count as half a
day without food. You can go
without food for a number of days
equal to 3 + your Constitution
modifier (minimum 1). Afterwards,
you take a level of exhaustion at the
end of each day without food.
WATER: You need 1 gallon of water
per day, 2 in hot weather. Half
water requires DC 15 Constitution
save; if you fail, you take a level of
exhaustion at the end of the day.
Not drinking any water causes an
automatic level of exhaustion at the
end of the day. If you already have a
level of exhaustion, take 2 levels
instead.
